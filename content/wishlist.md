I am trying to reduce the number of yatchs I fund for [Jeffrey Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos). As a result, I am adding a wishlist here for those people who are generous and kind enough to buy me a present. It's not as fancy as an Amazon wishlist, but I think together, we can make it work.

## Vouchers

Yep. Vouchers! üé´  

### HebTroCo

I am lucky enough to be able to afford nice and sustainable things. These aren't cheap, but they help me and they help the planet. However if you get me a voucher you're contributing to the nice, sustainable thing!

### Steam

There's always lots of video games on my Steam wishlist.

## But I want to BUY you something

Okey, I hear you. Here's a Google spreadsheet with some ideas on. But please add something to the "Purchased" column so others know you've made the purchase! This is on you guys‚Ä¶ 

### Please no more‚Ä¶

- Booze! üçª (I had a good run, but enough already‚Ä¶)
